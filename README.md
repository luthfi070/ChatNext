## About This Project

This is a very simple chat web, the main purpose of this web is to demonstrate the useful of Redux and Next by using ReactJS (and this is the most easiest and doable simple 
project for me) plus just to kill some time during my semester holiday.

Here i try to implement glassmorphism ( while i think its not too "glassy") design to make it more interesting. The tech that i used here is ReactJS, NextJS, and Redux.

## Tech Used

- ReactJS
- NextJS
- Redux

## How Does it work 

This website is created by using ReactJS, so it is state based and by useful of Redux it is much more easier, here everytime a user A send a message it will create a State Hook (not a Redux State), after that when the user click the send button it will send that state to Redux State so it became global and can be accessed on another page / file. While the use of Next is simply for Routing, it is much more easier rather than using react-router ( in my opinion ). Just like i said before, this web is simply for demonstrating the useful of Next and Redux
